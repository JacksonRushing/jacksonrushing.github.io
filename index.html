<p>I'm Jackson Rushing. I'm a Game Development and Entrepreneurship student at UOIT.</p>

<p>I love programming games, and I've made a couple, check them out!</p>

<p>R.E.D. was my project for the first semester of first year. It's a console based puzzle game with a ton of levels as well as a level editor. <a href="google.ca">check it out here!</a></p>

<p>SYF was my project for the second semester of first year. It's an arena based twin stick shooter that competed at a student games showcase, Level Up 2016 and won best first year game at UOIT's Gamecon 2016. <a href="https://inustudios.itch.io/syf?secret=nw6IdpMLAF6Z1wDLtv1SUAMNrw">Check it out here!</a></p>

<p>In second year, I worked on a local multiplayer game called Bustle. It competed at Level Up 2016, and is available for free on itch.io. <a href="https://moonwalk-studios.itch.io/bustle">Check it out here!</a></p>

<p>In between second year and third year, I worked on a VR game called Monday Night Mines. It was built for UOIT to show at university fairs to demonstrate the kind of things we do in the Game Development program - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zes9eHtGWyI">check out a trailer here!</a></p>

<p>During third year, I worked for a professor developing tools to teach first & second years concepts like <a href="http://jacksonrushing.com/vectortool.html">vector math</a>, <a href="https://moonwalk-studios.itch.io/bustle">3D transformations</a>, and <a href="http://jacksonrushing.com/physicstool.html">physics</a>.</p>

<p>I'm most experienced with gameplay programming, but I have a lot of experience developing tools and Unity extensions. <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohhwynwOHyblW0IU0/giphy.gif">Here's</a> an example of a tool I made to help our artists place waypoints while creating tracks for a racing game I'm currently working on. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/mKg0qIE.gifv">Here's</a> an editor window I worked on to go alongside a controller plugin to avoid using Unity's controller input system.</p>
