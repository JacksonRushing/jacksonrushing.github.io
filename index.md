### Hi!
I'm Jackson Rushing. I'm a Game Development and Entrepreneurship student at UOIT.

I love programming games, and I've made a couple, check them out!

R.E.D. was my project for the first semester of first year. It's a console based puzzle game with a ton of levels as well as a level editor. [check it out here!](google.ca)

SYF was my project for the second semester of first year. It's an arena based twin stick shooter that competed at a student games showcase, Level Up 2016 and won best first year game at UOIT's Gamecon 2016. [Check it out here!](https://inustudios.itch.io/syf?secret=nw6IdpMLAF6Z1wDLtv1SUAMNrw)
